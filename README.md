# zircon
A simple, composable distributed filesystem.

This is a 6.824 final project from Cel Skeggs and Robert Rusch.

This code is VERY BUGGY. Do not use this for production. We're still working on it!

Build the code with the build script in src/zircon, and use the launch script in the config-example directory to run an example.

You'll also need an etcd server; you can run the build script in src/github.com/coreos/etcd to compile that.
